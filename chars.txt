Kōnane was born into a world plagued by a cyberpunk dystopia, where the power dynamics were firmly controlled by a few influential corporations. In this oppressive society, access to space travel was restricted, limited only to these corporations and daring pirates who had managed to steal ships.

Growing up in the depths of this dystopia, Kōnane witnessed the exploitation and suppression of those who possessed natural access to magic. The corporations recognized the potential of magic as a valuable resource, and those born with innate magical abilities were seen as valuable commodities to be exploited for profit.

Despite the oppressive regime, Kōnane's thirst for knowledge and rebellion against the status quo led them on a path of discovery. Through secretive encounters with underground factions and their own relentless pursuit of knowledge, Kōnane uncovered the existence of the Nexus Rift—a phenomenon that could potentially unlock the full extent of magical abilities.

Recognizing the potential of the Nexus Rift as a source of liberation, Kōnane devoted themselves to uncovering its secrets and harnessing its power. They became a skilled mage, acquiring mastery over various magical disciplines and developing a deep understanding of the balance between magic and technology.

In their travels, Kōnane encountered individuals from all walks of life, witnessing firsthand the suffering caused by the exploitation of magic and the limitations imposed on space travel. The knowledge to learn magic had been deliberately kept hidden from the public to maintain control and prevent uprisings against the oppressive regime.

Realizing the need for change, Kōnane became an advocate for empowering individuals to harness their magical abilities. They believed that by uncovering the secrets of the Nexus Rift and granting access to magic for all, a revolution against the corporate tyranny could be sparked.

When Kōnane encounters the player, they see potential and an opportunity for change. While understanding the risks and dangers involved, Kōnane guides the player on their journey through the Nexus Rift, empowering them to explore the universe and discover the magic hidden within. They become a mentor and ally, imparting their knowledge and assisting the player in their quest to challenge the oppressive forces that seek to exploit magical abilities.
